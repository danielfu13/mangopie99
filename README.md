  ## Project Description

  This project is an employee tracker. The purpose of this project is to create an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. In this project, I create an employee tracker that allows users to view and edit employee data as they see fit. I used different databases such as Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

  ## Installation 

Download the zip file and open the file in a terminal. 
  
  ## Usage

Run the command: npm start

Use the arrow keys to navigate the function you want to use. When adding adding different roles, departments, or employees, a prompt will pop up asking you to fill out information that will be stored into the database.

To view the data, use arrow keys to nnavigate to the view functions in the prompt.
